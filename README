If you are looking for samples of my code please look to the MinMaxAI.java
in quoridorAI, the quoridorServer package, and the Game.java in quoridorClient.

Quoridor is played on a game board of 81 square spaces (9x9). Each player 
is represented by a pawn which begins at the center space of one edge of 
the board (in a two-player game, the pawns begin opposite each other). 
The objective is to be the first player to move their pawn to any space 
on the opposite side of the gameboard from which it begins.


In order to use our Quoridor game, you must first compile and run 
the Ant file:

$ ant build.xml

Then, you must spin up the Server in the quoridorServer package. The Server takes
two parameters: <port number> and <AI number> (the number of the AI that we want to use).
A full listing of the AI's can be found in Quoridor --> src --> quoridorAI
A valid Server start up could look something like this:

$ java quoridorServer.Server 3939 7

Lastly, you must spin up the Client in the quoridorClient package. The Client takes two
parameters: <host name: server port> and <our machine name: our port>. A valid Client start
up could look something like this:

$ java quoridorClient.Client localhost:3939 localhost:3838
